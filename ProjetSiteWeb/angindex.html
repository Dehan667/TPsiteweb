<div class="formec1"> <u> Self presentation of Kira Yoshikage :</u> </div>

<p>My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old.
 My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, 
where all the villas are, and I am not married. 
I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, 
and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. 
I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. 
I'm in bed by 11 PM, 
and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. 
After having a glass of warm milk 
and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, 
I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. 
Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. 
I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. 
I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, 
like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. 
That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. 
Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
