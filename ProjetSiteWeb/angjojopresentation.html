<p> What is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure ? (from Wikipedia)</p>
<p> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (Japanese: ジョジョの奇妙な冒険, Hepburn: JoJo no Kimyō na Bōken) is a Japanese manga series by Hirohiko Araki. It was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine by Shueisha from 1987 to 2004, and was transferred to the publisher's monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump in 2005. The series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the "JoJo" nickname; the eighth part, JoJolion, began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is Shueisha's longest ongoing manga series by volume count, with its chapters collected in 128 tankōbon volumes as of October 2020.

    A 13-episode original video animation series adapting the manga's third part, Stardust Crusaders, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released from 1993 to 2002. The studio later produced an anime film adapting the first part, Phantom Blood, which was released in theaters in Japan in 2007. In October 2012, an anime television series produced by David Production adapting Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency began broadcast on Tokyo MX. As of July 2019, the studio has produced four seasons adapting through the manga's fifth part, Golden Wind. A live-action film based on the fourth part, Diamond Is Unbreakable, was released in Japan in 2017.</p>
